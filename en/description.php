          <img src="images/opis-01.jpg" alt="" align="left" style="margin-right:25px;"> eDocu is a cloud information system for recording information, documents, tasks, work and deadlines.<br/><br/>
It easily records work documents and communication between the workers regarding the dealt issues inside the firm. All the information that are thus created are object-linked to things/objects. However, this way it is easier to go through information and be aware of the progress of the events on each of the things whether we are talking about a production machine or a legal case. Each thing recorded in the system can be provided with a QR code, similar to the earlier version of the barcodes. This marking system brings together with the eDocu system a unique feature of the direct access to information on the particular matter. Workers can easily get the operating instructions, wiring diagrams, information on previous repairs and maintenance right on-site. The system does not only serve for technical objects, but you can also use it to obtain information and documents of a particular legal dispute, contracts with a client or project delays.<br/><br/>
Since inside the system all of the information have timestamps and a recording of the author, you can efficiently look for a solution linked with chronology, responsibility and of course the content. To all records of the events and works it is possible to attach separate documents and pictures that most likely represent evidence or business records.
 Superiors can easily keep an eye on the overviews of the activities of the workers using the reports in which is recorded the work activity of an individual or a group. Reports can be created for different time periods from daily, weekly to reports between any two dates.<br/><br/>
Inventory of the property and objects helps you to keep track and have full control over the property, its deployment, value, status, and also recordings accompanied by pictures and documents.

		<div class="accordionContent"><img src="images/opis-09.jpg" style="margin-right:30px; margin-bottom:30px;" alt="" align="left"/><p>
The system is able to register individual objects , buildings, warehouses, etc. in the form of things. 
During the process of recording it can be determinated the type of the particular thing, such as compressor, engine, legal case, a car, etc. and its location: the address, place or an office. For each case, is then determined the “child”. This creates a system linking parents and children , which allows you to track a relation and hierarchy between things.
<br />
<br />
  <em>Example 1: THING: A car would have as children an engine, transmission, an airco, dashboard and a seat.<br/>In another sense its children would be represented by a control unit, an injection unit, air filter, condenser.</em><br/>
  <em>Example 2: THING: A building would have as a child, engine rooms, whereas their child would be represented by the ventilation and its child could represent a filter and a distributor.</em><br /><br/>
  This system provides recordings of things introducing hierarchy and order into things. It is then easy to search for a thing and information linked to it. For each case, it is possible to add documents considering their affiliation, for example instructions, a certificate, a wiring diagram, an audit report, an expert opinion, a list of service arrangements, as well as a warrant card, order or an invoice. Every thing has several other features that can be completed later and obtain that way accurate information.</p></div>
		<div class="accordionButton"><h3>Security</h3></div>
		<div class="accordionContent"><img src="images/opis-02.jpg" style="margin-right:30px; margin-bottom:30px;" alt="" align="left"/><p>eDocu system significally enhances the security of corporate and personal information. The way of ensuring the transmission and data is similar to the banking system. The connection is going on under an encrypted secure mode approved by a certificated authority. Servers are located in a secure data center. User data is stored in a highly secure servers based in Ireland.<br/><br/>
Any access to information is liable to a user login and all the activities are recorded along with the exact time. The system does not allow any deletion and/or elimination of data. 
eDocu can be hereby used as an evidence server. New or a corrected document is automatically loaded into the system as a new version with a brand new date. Work recordings are possible to be added to the system, as well as the comments on the executed work. Data security has a customer-oriented character.
<br/><br/>
<ul style="list-style:circle outside none;">
  <li style="padding-bottom:10px;">External security is oriented against the data loss caused by any outer attacks on communications and servers. When it comes to the material security, its secured by an armed security of the building of a data center; when it comes to data, they are secured using the latest technologies which are upgraded on a regular basis. Due to the physical security, the databases are geographically backed up in different places.</li>
  <li>Internal security is oriented against the information leakage by own employees. The system of remit divides people into particular groups according to the role they occupy at the company. It allows to separate, for example, the economic information from the technical ones. It is also possible according to the rights of the groups, control the access to precise projects, shares or clients’ cases. For any suspicious manipulation with the information of an employee, would be notified the responsible person at firm.</li>
</ul></p>
</div>
		<div class="accordionButton"><h3>Access 7/24/365</h3></div>
		<div class="accordionContent"><img src="images/opis-03.jpg" style="margin-right:30px; margin-bottom:30px;" alt="" align="left"/><p>Fully secured servers in a protected data center allow incessant access for the clients to their data virtually from anywhere where there is internet connection. Whether it is at home, where you are preparing yourself for next day’s proceedings or you need to accurately respond to the client's requirements in the field.<br/><br/>
Pictures and information can be recorded and loaded to the server right from the field, or to possibly get a current scheme, invoice, heating bill, or an instruction manual.
The access is optimized for classic PCs, laptops as well tablets and smartphones. The device is automatically detected and the visual of the page is therefore adapted appropriately. 
All the functions in the system can be used comfortably at the office so you can focus on the inclusion of the information and documents and controlling the activities of the employees and subcontractors.  In the comfort of your office, you can compare the supplier’s invoices received by mail with recorded works, right on your devices and immediately report any possible differences. <br/><br/>
In the field, it is easy to associate a picture taken at the inspection to the particular thing/object. These pictures or documentation can later serve as an evidence carrying the timestamp of the creation. It is also possible to get the information in the field via smartphones and therefore quickly and competently respond.<br/><br/>
This way the information and documents are shared. They can follow up on the others’ work. This data-sharing is bound to topics, cases and objects.
</p></div>
		<div class="accordionButton"><h3>Recordings of works</h3></div>
		<div class="accordionContent"><img src="images/opis-04.jpg" style="margin-right:30px; margin-bottom:30px;" alt="" align="left"/><p>eDocu allows you to keep records of work that are assigned to objects or events. For each record is registered a timestamp, the name of the person who executed the work, description / review and documentation. Since all the information and documents are linked to things/ objects, the system is always legible. To each entry of the work, it is possible to attach a comment.
Comments can be created by multiple people and at multiple times on the same record / topic. Recordings of work and its documentation or comments cannot be deleted . All the information regarding changes or additions, are sorted chronologically on a timeline as they were created. Work recordings are selected from the list, so there is no need of creative inventions of work or writing down the names. This feature simplifies and speeds up the writing the entry. Especially in the field is entering the recording of the work easier and faster, which encourages diligence in recruiting staff in executing the work recording.<br/><br/>
Recording of work is also a brilliant feature for checking the subcontracting firms. It makes it possible to monitor and document the execution of work of the subcontractors and the creation of suppliers’ documentation very accurately. It also provides a tool for continuous recording quality work and supplies and also leads communication bound to the object of supply. It is then always possible to come back to the problem objectively and in a particular time. Consistent requirement of the record-keeping from external suppliers provides a tool for maintaining documentation up to date, whether it is a legal case or a technical documentation for reworking distributor.
</p></div>
				<div class="accordionButton"><h3>Social network of things</h3></div>
		<div class="accordionContent"><img src="images/opis-06.jpg" style="margin-right:30px; margin-bottom:30px;" alt="" align="left"/><p>The function of the thingslive social network (life od things) is to show work and communication within the work team. This feature is meant for keeping track of current work in the company. The works on things are displayed worker by worker, with dynamic references to things and their documents. When you click on this link, you, as a user, are redicrected to an object or an action, which is displayed on the board of thingslive. Dynamic links are also used in the displayed works, the communication and comments written on thingslive social network. Dynamic links are color-coded and represent a shortcut to a thing, a person, a date or work.<br/><br/>
Profiles of people are displayed with their pictures, so it is easy to earn an overview by recognizing the faces of fellow workers and suppliers. When you click on the name of the person, you, as a user, are redirected to the board of this person where you can check the activities your colleague is currently working on. Activities are time sorted and when rolling down to the end of the list, the older page loads automatically.<br/><br/>
Social network makes the work on the system more pleasant, provides an overview and contact with colleagues creating interest in their work. It also maintains interest in the system and helps to reduce lethargy. The system allows you to spontaneously share recordings of the work, these become " known" in the company and this motivates colleagues to become better at their work. The visibility of the work of the employees and of the subcontractors increases the quality of the work because the progress and results are visible. 
</p></div>
				<div class="accordionButton"><h3>Access via QR codes</h3></div>
		<div class="accordionContent"><img src="images/opis-05.jpg" style="margin-right:30px; margin-bottom:30px;" alt="" align="left"/><p>eDocu also provides a unique access to information by scanning the QR codes. These can be placed directly on objects, things, rooms or documents. eDocu information system automatically generates a QR code for each thing and each document separately. Then it is possible to print the QR code and stick it onto the folder of documents, tangible property or any other thing. The QR code can be easily scanned by any kind of a QR code reader which is free to download for both major platforms such as iOS (Apple) and Android as well as many others. After the code is scanned, the smartphone or tablet connects to the server and displays the information attached to the precise thing. This way it is possible to obtain specific files, contracts, instructions and information needing no searching.</p></div>
				<div class="accordionButton"><h3>Reports of activities</h3></div>
		<div class="accordionContent"><img src="images/opis-07.jpg" style="margin-right:30px; margin-bottom:30px;" alt="" align="left"/><p>To streamline the activities of the department employees in the company or of the subcontractor provides the eDocu system, a possibility of creating reports. The report is a listing of the activities of one or more users for a particular period. This period can be represented by a day, week, month or any kind of interval between times. <br/><br/>
During the process of report listing, the activity is extracted and displayed in chronological order as it was recorded. Each activity is provided with a timestamp. Listings have a dynamic character just like listings in thingslive - social network of things.<br/><br/>
It is thus possible to extract recordings of work, comments, etc. directly from the attached documents. Extracted activity reports can be printed. Using this tool can be used to effectively control subordinates, partners or suppliers. This way not only the control can be improved but also trust.
</p></div>
				<div class="accordionButton"><h3>Timestamps</h3></div>
		<div class="accordionContent"><img src="images/opis-10.jpg" style="margin-right:30px; margin-bottom:30px;" alt="" align="left"/><p>A timestamp is a system tool for marking the event with exact time. It primarily serves for documenting the temporal context and sequence. It is non-editable and it cannot be deleted. Timestamps provide a powerful tool for supporting the demonstration in case of conflicts or as a help regarding analytical activities. By using this tool it is possible to clearly determine when was the last time when the event/matter occurred. Timestamps are also suitable for marking and later for demonstration of the timeframe in photo documentation since, in the case of digital pictures, which can be edited. eDocu system can then create a particular proof tool in case of disagreements in temporal chronology. Assignment of the task and the reply carrying the documentation are strictly connected by things and events, as well as the timestamp.</p></div>
				<div class="accordionButton"><h3>Remainder</h3></div>
		<div class="accordionContent"><img src="images/opis-08.jpg" style="margin-right:30px; margin-bottom:30px;" alt="" align="left"/><p>Reminder notifies you about the entered deadlines. For each item or file you can set an unlimited number of time reminders. In each reminder you can enter separately a text which will be sent by an e-mail with a notice about the up-to-dateness of the deadline. Each one of the reminders can contain several recipients. This way the system can thus notify you about the impending expiry of the contract, need of service inspection, deadline for submission of the tenders, etc.</p></div>
